"Usage: $(basename $0) [options...] command [packagelist]

Available commands:
    help                print this help text
    write               write a list of currently installed packages
    install             install packages on list not currently installed
    script              output a script to install missing packages
    
Options:
    -u                  update the package database
    -t                  test only, execute opkg commands with --noaction
    -v                  be verbose

$SCRIPTNAME can be used to re-install those packages that were installed
before a firmware upgrade but are not part of the new firmware image.

Before the firmware upgrade, execute

    $SCRIPTNAME [options...] write [packagelist]
    
to save the list of currently installed packages. Save the package list in a 
place that will not be wiped out by the firmware upgrade. The default package list
is '$PCKGLIST', which works well for normal sysupgrades. Or copy that file to 
another computer before the upgrade if you are not preserving the settings.

After the firmware upgrade, execute

    $SCRIPTNAME [options...] install [packagelist]
    
to re-install all packages that were not part of the firmware image. 
By default, the script will use the previously-created '$PCKGLIST'.
Alternatively, you can execute

    $SCRIPTNAME [options...] script [packagelist]
    
to output a shell script that will contain calls to opkg to install those
missing packages. This might be useful if you want to check which packages
would be installed of if you want to edit that list.

In order for this script to work after a firmware upgrade or reboot, the
opkg database must have been updated. You can use the option -u to do this.

You can specify the option -t to test what $SCRIPTNAME would do. All calls
to opkg will be made with the option --noaction. This does not influence
the call to opkg to write the list of installed packages, though.
